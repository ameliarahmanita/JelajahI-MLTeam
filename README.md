# Machine Learning Used
In crafting JelajahI's cutting-edge image recognition model, we leverage state-of-the-art machine learning libraries such as **TensorFlow and Keras**. Our methodology follows a systematic approach, from the initial step of importing these powerful libraries to the intricate process of training and testing our model. Utilizing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning**, we harness the potency of deep learning to refine our image recognition capabilities. The seamless integration of **TensorFlow.js (TFJS)** ensures that our model not only excels in training but also translates seamlessly into the interactive realm of our application. With meticulous attention to detail at each stage, JelajahI's image recognition stands as a testament to our commitment to delivering a robust and innovative user experience.
